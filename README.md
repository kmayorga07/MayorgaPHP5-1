Using PHP to manipulate characters in strings

Title: Name Phrase

Purpose: The idea behind this program is to utilize certain functions in a string to manipulate the output.

Instructions: The user will be prompted to enter their name followed by their favorite saying or catchphrase. Once submitted, the program begins getting to work first by naming the variables needed to complete the tasks. The 1st task is to display the name and phrase of the user, then it displays how many words and the character count of the phrase. The 2nd task is to display the phrase as a title or heading, to do that it shows the phrase with the first character of each word capitalized, and it shows the whole phrase capitalized. The 3rd task is set to replace every vowel in the phrase with a "*" character.*"Finally the 4th task is to display each word of the phrase on its own line.

Please enjoy :)
